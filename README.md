# Description

The pet project is a 3D model gallery built with React, where users can interact with the models by rotating them and changing the background. The project was created for the purpose of practicing the Three.js library. Users can explore different 3D models and manipulate them in a virtual environment, providing an interactive and engaging experience. This project serves as a learning opportunity for implementing Three.js in a React application and showcasing 3D modeling capabilities.
